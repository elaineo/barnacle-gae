My mother picked through my carryon bag for something to wear. We were on a family trip to Orlando, and United Airlines had lost my parents’ checked bags.
</p><p>
My brother and I had packed all our clothes in our carryon luggage. My parents could have done that too, of course, but they checked in two suitcases because they felt compelled to bring a week's supply of food with them. Restaurants are expensive, you know.
</p><p>
My father couldn’t fit into my 12-year-old brother’s clothes, so he took to washing his underpants in the motel room sink every night. 
</p><p>
I don’t blame the airlines for sucking at luggage. They have a tough job. And their employees are unionized.

My 50-year-old mother refused to wear any of the halter tops that I brought for the trip. I didn’t see why it was such a big deal. She was already wearing my clean underwear and we were well past the point of propriety.
</p><p>
Finally, she pulled out a t-shirt that I had intended to use as a sleep shirt.
</p><p>
“I'll wear this one,” she said. 
</p><p>
It was a red shirt with the words "Ok, but wash it first" printed across the front. I had made it in my college screenprinting class.
</p><p>
“What does it mean?” she asked. My mother’s English isn’t very good.
</p><p>
“Ah, it’s a warning about eating raw fruit and vegetables,” I explained. “You know, because there was a salmonella outbreak and stuff.”
</p><p>
Then we all went to Walt Disney World. The airline found my parents’ bags just in time for us to pick them up at the airport on our flight back.
</p><p>
Don’t give your bags to an airline employee. Use Peer-to-Peer Postal.
