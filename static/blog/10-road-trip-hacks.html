        Barnacle Drivers, having driven coast-to-coast four times, plus two additional trips halfway and back, I’ve made enough mistakes that people ask me for advice on what not to do.  If you’re planning a road trip, here’s a few hacks to make your trip stellar:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
        <li>	West &gt; East: If you have any flex days, spend it absorbing the breathtaking scenery in the Rockies.  Spend some extra time hiking or sightseeing.  Everything east of the Rockies is flat, so you can safely gun it in these parts to make up for lost time.
        <li>	Visit the Badlands: The exception to #1, perhaps the most remarkable wonder of the world.
        <li>	Keep to the Code: Follow proper etiquette and everybody wins.  Most notably, keep in the right lane except when you’re passing and others will respect you as an experienced driver.
        <li>	10 MPH Over: This seems to be the sweet spot to avoid getting tickets.
        <li>	Bring a Travel Mug: If you drink as much coffee as I do (unlikely), this will get you a lot of discounts along the way and keep your coffee drinkable for longer.  For whatever reason disposable cups always result in coffee stains all over everything.
        <li>	Bring a Mini-Cooler: Keep sandwiches and fruit, as this can be tough to access in some regions.  Freeze a water bottle overnight and keep in the cooler to avoid having to deal with messy ice (you get ice cold water when it melts).
        <li>	Bring a Car Charger: Make sure to support your digitial hipsterati lifestyle by keeping your entire groups’ gadgets charged.  GPS features drain phone batteries like nobody’s business.
        <li>	Must Have Apps: A handful of apps are a necessity:
            <ul>
                
        <li>	Waze: Has gone downhill somewhat since acquisition, but great for predicting cops and avoiding traffic jams.
        <li>	Google Maps: Their navigation features tend to work a bit better when internet access is low, plus it generally has more robust mapping and routing.
        <li>	GasBuddy: Switch this to map view and look forward on your route to get a sense of whether nearby gas prices are rising or falling.
        <li>	Barnacle: The driver tracker app made my aunt very happy, as she knew exactly when I was pulling in and had hot soup ready on my arrival.
            </ul>
        <li>	Know Where Apps Fail: Phone providers claim 99% coverage, but the 1% gaps seem to be along major roads.  Your phone will fail, especially in the Rockies, so make sure your navigator has an idea of what lies ahead.
        <li>	Deliver for Barnacle: Post your route at http://gobarnacle.com/ and carry some packages along your route.  You may end up turning a profit on your road trip.
        </ol>
        
        Safe travels!
