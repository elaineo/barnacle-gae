        Sammy the Shark is <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>’s mascot and a huge fan of road trips. A week after helping his team raise their Series A round, he visited Austin for SXSW.</p><p>
        He flew down from NYC, which wasn’t terribly fun, because his team stuffed him into a large cardboard box. Worse yet, they paid $1500 for that last-minute ticket on FedEx Airlines.
        </p><p>
        After a fun week of meeting DigitalOcean fans at the SXSW Interactive Trade Show, it was time to go home. Instead of flying in a box, Sammy instead chose to hitch a ride with a Barnacle driver who had an extra seat. Well, more like an extra whole backseat, folded down. Sammy is a bit rotund, and the BBQ brisket in Austin did not help.

        The trip took him through Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia, then up through the Northeast through some extreme weather conditions before finally returning home.

        Exciting stuff! Barnacle is looking forward to providing Sammy with his next road trip experience!
