<small>Anna, our lovely Barnacle driver</small>
</p><p>
I learned about Barnacle from a campus flyer. I didn’t get any delivery requests the first time I posted my route up to Berkeley, but I kept using the app anyway because my parents liked being able to know where I am on long drives.
</p><p>
Over Thanksgiving, I got a message from Linda, through Barnacle. Her father had recently passed away, and had a collection of rare cloth-bound books that she wanted to bring back to Los Altos from her family’s home in Richmond. We scheduled a time for me to pick up the books, and her brother helped load them into my Corolla (books sure are heavy!)
</p><p>
I drove down to Los Altos and swung by Linda’s home to drop them off before going to my parents’ house for the long weekend. Linda had the sweetest family, and they invited me to stay for their Thanksgiving dinner! Sadly, I was in a hurry, so after we unloaded all the boxes I had to leave. But Linda cut a piece of pie for me to take home!
</p><p>
I’ve met the nicest people through Barnacle, and am having so much fun as a driver!

<small>Robert, a happy Barnacle customer</small>
</p><p>
I drive between SoCal and the bay area pretty often for work, and Barnacle sometimes helps me pay for gas. On one trip, a Barnacle user Robert asked me to pick up a set of Recaro seats in San Diego. He gave me the phone number of his seller, and I connected with him at the Valero off the freeway exit in Encinitas. The seats folded up in my trunk and I delivered them up to Robert’s shop in Santa Clara. 
</p><p>
Robert showed me a GT40 replica that he’s building, and he has plans to race it when it’s finished. He invited me to come to the track to help out in the pits when he races, and I will be looking forward to that for sure!
