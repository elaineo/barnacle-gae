        On a recent <a href="http://gobarnacle.com/track/view/agtzfnAycHBvc3RhbHIZCxIMVHJhY2tlck1vZGVsGICAgICu7IwKDA">cross-country Barnacle delivery</a> across 16 northern states, I hit rough snow in 15 of them.  It’s best to simply stay off the roads whenever possible, but sometimes this just isn’t an option.  If you must drive long-distances through a polar vortex, here’s some tips.

        <li><p><b>Fluidate</b> Driving the interstate, one of the biggest problems was trucks and other cars kicking up all sorts of gunk onto your windshield.  In particular, the salt they use to keep the roads drive-able will build up quickly on your windshield.  We ended up going through several gallons of wiper fluid, so keep some extra stocked in your car.</p>

        <li>	<p><b>Drive Unexcitement:</b> Save your speed records for a clear day.  Follow the tracks left by cars in front of you and you’ll often find the freeway is only slippery when making lane changes.  Leave several car lengths between you and the next driver and you can avoid slamming on the brakes.  Executed properly, you’ll find you can cruise comfortably as if you were driving in normal conditions.</p>
        
        <li>	<p><b>Broadcast Your Journey:</b> Keep the <a href="http://gobarnacle.com/tracker">Barnacle driver tracker</a> open while you’re driving and post it to your friends and family.  If you run into trouble, your network will know quickly and easily be able to report your last known location to authorities.</p>

        <p>Safe travels!</p>
