        On a recent <a href="http://gobarnacle.com/track/view/agtzfnAycHBvc3RhbHIZCxIMVHJhY2tlck1vZGVsGICAgICu7IwKDA">cross-country Barnacle delivery</a> across 16 northern states, I hit rough snow in 15 of them.  It’s best to simply stay off the roads whenever possible, but sometimes this just isn’t an option.  If you must drive long-distances through a polar vortex, here’s some tips.

        <li><p><b>Fluidate</b> Driving the interstate, one of the biggest problems was trucks and other cars kicking up all sorts of gunk onto your windshield.  In particular, the salt they use to keep the roads drive-able will build up quickly on your windshield.  We ended up going through several gallons of wiper fluid, so keep some extra stocked in your car.</p>

        <li>	<p><b>Drive Unexcitement:</b> Save your speed records for a clear day.  Follow the tracks left by cars in front of you and you’ll often find the freeway is only slippery when making lane changes.  Leave several car lengths between you and the next driver and you can avoid slamming on the brakes.  Executed properly, you’ll find you can cruise comfortably as if you were driving in normal conditions.</p>
            
            <li>	<p><b>Cold Crushes Some Car Parts:</b> Even if your car had a clean bill of health in the summer, you still might run into trouble outside Fargo.  Did you know your tires lose about one pound of air pressure for every 10 degree temperature drop?  The battery also discharges quicker in the cold, which can cause problems trying to start your car.  Lastly check the cooling system, and make sure to use about 50-50 antifreeze to water.</p>
                
                <li>	<p><b>Practice Makes Perfect:</b> Next time it snows, find the nearest abandoned parking lot and have some fun.  A little experience steering into the skid or testing how your brakes react to ice can give you the intuition you need to be a safe winter driver.</p>
                    
                    <li>	<p><b>See your Tank as Half Full:</b> Stranded on the side of the road?  No problem... keep the engine running, crack open a good book, and wait for help.  Oh, did you run out of gas?  Hope you're wearing your long johns.</p>

              <li>	<p><b>Plow You See Me...</b> All the traditional literature says not to pass snow plows.  If you do, stay on the shoulder, keep a wide berth, and you'll enjoy a wide open road ahead to yourself.</p>

       
        <li>	<p><b>Broadcast Your Journey:</b> Keep the <a href="http://gobarnacle.com/tracker">Barnacle driver tracker</a> open while you’re driving and post it to your friends and family.  If you run into trouble, your network will know quickly and easily be able to report your last known location to authorities.</p>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Safe travels!</p>
