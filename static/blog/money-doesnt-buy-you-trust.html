“How do I know a hitchhiker won't dismember me with an axe?”
</p><p>
People who ask this question would never pick up a hitchhiker in the first place. The hitchhiker could sign a restraining order, pinky swear, or offer to underwrite your life insurance policy, and none of it would matter. If you don’t trust a stranger, you don’t trust a stranger.
</p><p>
The people who have used P2P Postal thus far have not raised any questions about trust or insurance. Completed deliveries include several motorcycles, some car parts, a cake, a guitar, and a dog. Not once did someone ask, “How do I know you’re not going to run off with my stuff?” People who are willing to entertain the idea of having a stranger transport their things don't place much weight on the probability of loss. 
</p><p>
P2P Postal does work with drivers to provide insurance options, but in nearly all cases, the customer doesn’t want it. It’s about trust -- You have it or you don’t. It's not for sale. 
</p><p>
One upcoming P2P Postal reservation involves a mountain biker who wants to transport a high-end mountain bike. He has requested insurance from a third-party provider, but I suspect he will cancel. The trust simply is not there.
</p><p>
P2P Postal is not for everyone. If a customer can be assuaged by the promise of loss reimbursement, then a professional shipping service is probably more appropriate.  
</p><p>
Airbnb does provide insurance coverage in the event that your home gets trashed, but most users would probably prefer that their home not get trashed. 
Monetary compensation is not a tool for building trust in a sharing economy.
