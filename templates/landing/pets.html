              I brought my chocolate lab on a flight when I first moved to San Francisco. When we arrived, she was terrified and the hairs on her muzzle had gone white! I never want to put her through that again. On the trip back, we used Barnacle and she was much happier.

              I am a breeder, and I know how traumatic it is for animals to travel by air. Barnacle lets me send my puppies all over the west coast. It is perfect for my needs.
