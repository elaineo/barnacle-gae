              Flying with my double bass has always been a huge hassle for me. Barnacle got my bass to me in Los Angeles for my last gig and back home again. This is awesome.

              I bought a used full-stack Crate amp from a guy in San Francisco, and had a heck of a time figuring out how to ship it. I found Barnacle through a forum recommendation, and had a driver bringing my amp down the next weekend. I am so glad this service exists!

              I always want to bring my Fender Strat home for the holidays to jam with my old band, but I had to stop checking it in on the airlines after they damaged it the last time. Amber from Barnacle took sweet care of my baby.
