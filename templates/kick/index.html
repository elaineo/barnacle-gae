<h3>Barnacle Kickstarter Campaign</h3>
<p>Modeled after the <a href='http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ailian/thank-you-project'>Thank You Project</a>.</p>
<p>Proposal: Handcrafted care packages delivered by Barnacle. Spreading random acts of kindness.</p>
<p>The Story: Because the people we care about might think we've forgotten about them. We don't send care packages because the recipients are incapable of feeding themselves; we send care packages to remind them that we care.</p>
<img src='/static/img/kick/cupcakes.jpg' width='300px'>
<p>What: Should be something that would get destroyed in the mail. I was thinking about baking cupcakes or something, but my cupcakes are ugly. Maybe I'll get Kathy to help me make them less ugly. Or maybe the ugliness lends to the charm. 
<br>Other ideas?</p>

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<p>Goal: $1000 (?)</p>
<p>For each backer, I will assemble a care package and a Barnacle driver will deliver it to a recipient in California. </p>
<p>Stretch Goals: Each time fundraising gains another $500 (?), I will open up deliveries to an adjacent state. I want to make the states contiguous so that, if I can't find any drivers, I could potentially drive out there myself. Actually, that would be fun.</p>

<h4>Rewards</h4>
<p>$5 (?) - a Barnacle magnet or something</p>
<p>$20 (?) - 1 care package to 1 recipient</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much to ask for. The raw materials will cost about 50 cents per care package, and the rest will go to the driver. Cookie baskets go for $30-$50 plus shipping/handling on proflowers, but they are nicer-looking than what I could make. </p>
<p>Should I offer something to the sender? A Thank You postcard?</p>

<h4>Obstacles</h4>
<p>Need to portray this in such a way that the purpose is aligned with Barnacle's purpose. 
<ul><li>Are we demonstrating to people that they can now send things they previously would not have considered sending in the mail?</li> 
<li>Are we trying to tell them that Barnacle is caring?</li> 
<li>Are we just generating demand for Barnacle drivers in a really circuitous way?</li></ul></p>
<p>Videographer. Man, producing a video is harder than it looks.</p>

<h4>Potential Risks</h4>
<p><b>1. Zero backers :(</b></p>
<p>Worst-case scenario: A lot of wasted time.</p>
<p>How to mitigate risk: Bribe my friends to make donations on the first day. Back myself with a fake account.</p>
<p><b>2. Zero drivers</b></p>
<p>Worst-case scenario: For $1000 + $500x, I could probably hire Craigslist people to drive to the state. Or I'll just do it. </p>
<p><b>3. This takes a lot of time</b></p>
<p>How to Mitigate risk: Sleep less?</p>
<p><b>4. People see this as an underhanded ploy to promote Barnacle</b></p>
<p>I don't know. They would be correct in thinking that.</p>
